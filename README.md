# Python TypeError in Division with Incompatible Types

This repository demonstrates a less common TypeError that can occur in Python when performing division with incompatible data types.  The code includes examples of both the expected ZeroDivisionError and the less common TypeError, highlighting how these errors manifest in different scenarios.

The included `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code which performs division operation with incompatible data types. The `bugSolution.py` file offers improved error handling using type checking and more robust exception handling to prevent these errors.
